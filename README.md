# TopDown2dCharacterController

This is a project in Unity, it started as me just messing around with some basic movement to emulate something similar to pokemon.
I liked the way it turned out so I decided to start making a game using it. It's also a way for me to learn some basics of coding.

How to open:
1. Start unity
2. go "open project' and navigate to the folder with "assests" and "projectsettings" in it
3. Unity will recognize that as a project
4. Once loaded, open a scene (probably the one with the movement stuff in it)
